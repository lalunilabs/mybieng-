  "content": "# Stress Patterns: 3 Reset Levers That Work in Real Life\n\nWhen stress rises, three levers consistently help: **sleep**, **movement**, and **attention**.\n\n## 1) Sleep (the base layer)\n- Keep a steady window.\n- Dim lights and screens 60 minutes before bed.\n- Anchor wake time even after bad nights.\n\n## 2) Movement (circulate the load)\n- Small is enough: 8–12 minutes counts.\n- Walk after meals.\n- Stretch the areas that tighten under stress (jaw, traps, hips).\n\n## 3) Attention (reduce mental overheat)\n- Timebox tasks to 25 minutes.\n- Clear notifications for 2 hours a day.\n- Write down “3 realistic wins” for the day.\n\n## How to use your quiz results\nTake the **Stress Patterns** quiz and notice which signals are loudest. Pick one lever. Make it easier than you think. Do it daily for 7 days and reassess.\n\n## Next steps\n- Re-run the quiz after a week.\n- Ask the AI for a 7-day reset plan.\n- Track your best lever over a month.\n",
