### **Email 2: The Science Behind It (Send 2 days later)**

**Subject:** Why your brain keeps you stuck (and how to break free)

**Body:**
```
[Name],

Quick question: Ever notice how you keep making the same mistakes?

It's not willpower. It's not motivation. It's pattern recognition.

Your brain is a pattern-matching machine. Once it learns "this situation = this response," that becomes your default‚Äîeven when you consciously want to do something different.

Here's what Harvard research revealed:

‚Üí 78% of people have significant gaps between their values and behaviors
‚Üí But the people who ACKNOWLEDGED this gap were happier and more successful
‚Üí Awareness of the pattern, not elimination of it, was the key

That's why our assessments focus on understanding, not fixing.

Because once you see your patterns clearly, you can finally work WITH them instead of against them.

### **Email 3: The Change Mistake (Send 4 days later)**

**Subject:** The #1 mistake that keeps you stuck

**Body:**
```
[Name],

The #1 mistake people make when trying to change?

They try to change their behavior instead of their identity.

Here's what I mean:

‚ùå **Behavior change:** "I need to stop procrastinating"
‚úÖ **Identity change:** "I'm becoming someone who takes action"

‚ùå **Behavior change:** "I should exercise more"  
‚úÖ **Identity change:** "I'm becoming someone who prioritizes health"

Your brain will fight to keep your behavior consistent with your identity.

So the question isn't "What do I need to do differently?"

It's "Who do I need to become?"

Our assessments help you see not just what you do, but WHO you are at the pattern level.

Because once you understand your identity patterns, change becomes natural.

[Name],

After analyzing 10,000+ assessments, we discovered something shocking:
