# MyBeing Branding & Domain Strategy

## Current Situation
The `mybeing.in` domain currently shows generic content that doesn't reflect our actual MyBeing organization and its Personal Health Environment (PHE) mission. This creates confusion and dilutes our brand identity.

## MyBeing Brand Identity

### Core Mission
MyBeing is a Personal Health Environment (PHE) platform that empowers individuals to:
- Control their health, wellbeing, and fitness data
- Discover insights through research-backed content
- Engage in self-discovery through personalized quizzes
- Access AI-powered conversations for deeper understanding

### Key Differentiators
- **Research-backed content**: All content is grounded in scientific research
- **No right/wrong answers**: Focus on deductive analysis and pattern recognition
- **Personal growth focus**: Individual self-awareness rather than business solutions
- **Data ownership**: Users control their own health and wellness data
- **Premium experience**: Quality over quantity with strategic pacing

## Domain Strategy Options

### Option 1: Secure mybeing.in Domain
**Pros:**
- Perfect brand match
- Short and memorable
- .in extension suitable for personal/individual focus

**Actions Required:**
- Contact current domain owner
- Negotiate purchase or licensing
- Implement proper redirects from current content

### Option 2: Alternative Domain Options
**Primary Alternatives:**
- `mybeing.com` (if available)
- `mybeing.co`
- `mybeing.app`
- `my-being.com`
- `getmybeing.com`

**Secondary Options:**
- `mybeingphe.com`
- `beingmyself.com`
- `personalbeing.com`

### Option 3: Subdomain Strategy (Temporary)
- Use `app.mybeing.org` or similar
- Redirect to proper domain once secured

## Immediate Actions

### 1. Content Audit & Cleanup
- Remove any generic placeholder content
- Ensure all content reflects MyBeing's PHE mission
- Update meta descriptions and SEO content

### 2. Brand Consistency
- Consistent use of "MyBeing" (not "My Being" or "mybeing")
- Tagline: "Your Personal Health Environment"
- Focus messaging on self-discovery and personal growth

### 3. Legal Protection
- Trademark "MyBeing" and "Personal Health Environment (PHE)"
- Register relevant domain variations
- Protect brand assets

## Technical Implementation

### SEO Optimization
```html
<title>MyBeing - Your Personal Health Environment</title>
<meta name="description" content="Take control of your health, wellbeing, and fitness data through research-backed content, personalized quizzes, and AI-powered insights for personal growth.">
<meta property="og:title" content="MyBeing - Personal Health Environment">
<meta property="og:description" content="Discover yourself through research-backed content and personalized assessments. Your data, your insights, your growth.">
```

### Brand Colors & Visual Identity
- Primary: Purple (#7C3AED) - represents wisdom and introspection
