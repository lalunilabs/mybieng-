### How does the Mental Tug of War assessment work?
The Mental Tug of War assessment identifies cognitive dissonance patterns across five key areas: instant justification, gradual belief shift, selective evidence collection, identity protection, and social reality distortion. There are no right or wrong answers - it's designed for pattern recognition and self-awareness.

### Is MyBeing based on scientific research?
Yes, all MyBeing assessments and content are grounded in peer-reviewed research from psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral science. We focus on evidence-based approaches to self-discovery and personal growth.
