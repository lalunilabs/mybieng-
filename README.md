Self-insight quizzes and research-backed blog platform scaffolded with Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Quick start

1. Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Visit http://localhost:3000

## Structure

- `app/` — App Router pages, API routes, and global styles
- `components/` — Reusable UI components
- `data/` — In-memory sample data for blogs and quizzes

## Notes

- This is a starter scaffold: no auth, payments, or database yet.
- API routes are read-only and serve in-memory data for now.
- Admin/Dashboard pages are placeholders for upcoming implementation.

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in values as needed.
