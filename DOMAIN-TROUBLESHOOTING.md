```

**Expected Results:**

### Step 2: Verify Netlify Configuration

**Check Netlify Dashboard:**

2. Navigate to **Site Settings** ‚Üí **Domain Management**
3. Verify these settings:

```
Primary Domain: mybeing.in

```

### Step 3: Fix DNS Records in GoDaddy

**Login to GoDaddy DNS Management:**
