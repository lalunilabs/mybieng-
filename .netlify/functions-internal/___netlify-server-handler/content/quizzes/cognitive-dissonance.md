# The Mental Tug-of-War: Cognitive Dissonance Assessment

This assessment helps you identify the hidden contradictions between your stated values and daily actions. There are no right or wrong answers—only patterns to discover.

## Instructions

- Answer honestly based on your recent behavior (past 2-4 weeks)
- Focus on patterns, not isolated incidents
- Rate your agreement with each statement
- Results will reveal your primary dissonance patterns

## Scoring & Analysis

### Pattern Identification

**Instant Justification Score** (Q1-3): Average of questions 1-3
**Belief Shift Score** (Q4-6): Average of questions 4-6  
**Evidence Collection Score** (Q7-9): Average of questions 7-9
**Identity Protection Score** (Q10-12): Average of questions 10-12
**Mental Energy Score** (Q13-15): Average of questions 13-15
**Alignment Score** (Q16-18): Average of questions 16-18 (reverse scored)

### Results Interpretation

**Overall Dissonance Level** = (Instant Justification + Belief Shift + Evidence Collection + Identity Protection + Mental Energy) / 5

**Low Dissonance (1.0-2.0)**: You're generally aligned with your values
**Moderate Dissonance (2.1-3.5)**: Some areas need attention
**High Dissonance (3.6-5.0)**: Significant value-action gaps detected

### Primary Pattern Types

**The Instant Justifier**: High scores in Q1-3
**The Belief Shifter**: High scores in Q4-6
**The Evidence Collector**: High scores in Q7-9
**The Identity Protector**: High scores in Q10-12
**The Energy Drainer**: High scores in Q13-15

## Personalized Recommendations

### For High Instant Justification:
- Practice the "friend test" - what would you tell a friend in your situation?
- Track your justifications for one week to spot patterns
- Use the 30-second pause before making decisions

### For High Belief Shift:
- Write down your core values and review them weekly
- Identify where your beliefs have drifted from your original values
- Create "integrity experiments" to realign actions with values

### For High Evidence Collection:
- Seek out contradictory evidence deliberately
- Ask people with different perspectives for feedback
- Practice considering the opposite viewpoint

### For High Identity Protection:
- Challenge identity statements with "what if I could..."
- Focus on behaviors rather than identity labels
- Create small experiments that test your assumptions

### For High Mental Energy Drain:
- Track energy levels throughout the day
- Identify which decisions cause the most mental fatigue
- Use the 6-week dissonance detection plan from the article

1. **Daily Awareness**: Set 3 random phone alarms to check for mental discomfort
2. **Weekly Review**: Track instances of contradictory behavior
3. **Monthly Alignment**: Assess progress on value-behavior alignment

## Research Backing

This assessment is based on:
- Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory (1957)
- Aronson's self-concept research
- Steele's identity protection studies
- Modern neuroscience of value-behavior alignment

Remember: This is an assessment for insight, not judgment. The goal is awareness, not perfection.
