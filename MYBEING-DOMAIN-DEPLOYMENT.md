## Immediate Action Plan

### Step 1: Choose Your Deployment Platform

#### Option A: Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy from your project directory
cd /Users/niharikasai/mybeing
vercel --prod

# Add custom domain
vercel domains add mybeing.in
vercel domains add www.mybeing.in
```

#### Option B: Netlify
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm i -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy
netlify deploy --prod --dir=.next
```

### Step 2: Configure DNS in GoDaddy

1. **Login to GoDaddy DNS Management**
   - Go to [dcc.godaddy.com](https://dcc.godaddy.com)
   - Select your `mybeing.in` domain
   - Click "DNS" â†’ "Manage Zones"

2. **Add DNS Records**

   **For Vercel:**
   ```
   Type: A
   Name: @
   Value: 76.76.19.61
   TTL: 1 Hour
   
   Type: CNAME  
   Name: www
   Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
   TTL: 1 Hour
   ```

   **For Netlify:**
   ```
   Type: A
   Name: @
   Value: 75.2.60.5
   TTL: 1 Hour
   
   Type: CNAME
   Name: www  
   Value: [your-site-name].netlify.app
   TTL: 1 Hour
   ```

### Step 3: Update Environment Variables

Ensure your production environment has the correct domain:

```bash
# In your deployment platform, set:
NEXT_PUBLIC_DOMAIN=https://mybeing.in
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://mybeing.in
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME=MyBeing
```

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

After DNS propagation (24-48 hours):

1. **Test Domain Resolution**
   ```bash
   # Check if domain resolves
   nslookup mybeing.in
   
   # Test HTTPS
   curl -I https://mybeing.in
   ```

2. **Verify Site Functionality**
   - [ ] Homepage loads with PHE branding
   - [ ] Ads appear in sidebar only (not middle)
   - [ ] Quiz pages work correctly
   - [ ] SSL certificate is active
   - [ ] Mobile responsiveness

## Quick Deploy Commands

```bash
# One-time setup
npm i -g vercel
vercel login

# Deploy with custom domain
cd /Users/niharikasai/mybeing
vercel --prod
vercel domains add mybeing.in
```

### If using Netlify:
```bash
# One-time setup  
npm i -g netlify-cli
netlify login
